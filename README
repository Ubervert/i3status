THIS IS AN UNOFFICIAL FORK!

 ┌────────────────────────────┐
 │ About this fork            │
 └────────────────────────────┘
This fork adds mpd and pianobar output.

For pianobar support, you must move i3status/contrib/eventcmd.sh to
~/.config/pianobar/

To config pianobar output, edit the script with the defined variables inside it.

Additionally, you must enable the script in ~/.config/pianobar/config

Add to bashrc
	alias pianobar='pianobar && echo - > ~/.config/pianobar/nowplaying'
This will clear the status bar when pianobar closes 

mpd support created by:
 https://github.com/Gravemind/i3status.git	

Added dependencies:
 •libmpdclient

 └────────────────────────────┘

i3status is a small program (about 1500 SLOC) for generating a status bar for
i3bar, dzen2, xmobar or similar programs. It is designed to be very efficient by
issuing a very small number of system calls, as one generally wants to update
such a status line every second. This ensures that even under high load, your
status bar is updated correctly. Also, it saves a bit of energy by not hogging
your CPU as much as spawning the corresponding amount of shell commands would.

i3status has the following dependencies:
 • libconfuse-dev
